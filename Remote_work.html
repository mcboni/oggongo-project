        <P>Working remotely, the new normal for a lot of companies on this side of the globe may have come to stay for most companies in Lagos. For a mega city like Lagos, working remotely is a recommended way to go for a lot of companies as technology has made that option very viable now but are companies really ready for this option?</P>





        <P>Before the Covid-19 Pandemic, working remotely was not a welcomed idea for a lot of companies in Lagos even when they had genuine situations that warranted it as an option because they feared they may not get maximum productivity from staff. They would rather have their staff physically present at all cost. So, daily from very early in the day to late at night, Lagosians commute to and from work in heavy traffic and hopping from one bus to another, wasting a lot of time and energy on the road. They arrive work tired from the stress of commuting with part of their work time expended in traffic.
        </P>


        <P>A case in point is one of my colleagues who lives far away on the mainland, he would come to work already looking drained and sweaty by 8am in the morning, thank goodness for air conditioner which helps to ease off the stress and sweat a bit but lulls him to sleep for some time before resuming for the day’s work. He had to speak with my boss about it and they came up with a plan to allow him work remotely for some days of the week and guess what?... he became more productive, happier and healthier.
        </P>

        <div class="firstimage">
          <p><img src="css/remote2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="remote"></p>
        </div>

        <P>Contrary to what has been believed, feedbacks from my colleagues and some of friends have been working remotely before the pandemic reveal that they are more productive. Speaking with a couple of them extensively on their experiences working remotely, I gathered that they work for longer hours than when they work from their office space as they have no specific closing time and are very conscious of their deliverables.
        </P>



        <P>When Lagosians don’t have to think of waking up pretty early to catch the bus or face and endure the gruesome traffic daily, they will be happier and more productive. Life expectancy too will increase and stress related illness will reduce drastically. People will live in their choice locations with affordable houses as opposed living in expensive locations in attempt to cope with the Lagos stress and forced to squatting with friends or share apartments with strangers to make up for rent in those highbrow areas that are closer to their office and can save a lot of money on their lifestyle too with rent, transport etc. I had that experience when I got my first job on the island, my aunt's house away on the mainland and commuting to work on the island daily was taking its toll on me, rent on the island was exorbitant and not even an option because with my salary at the time it will be asking for too much. When I couldn’t cope anymore, I began to consider resigning from my job but one day I was talking to a friend about my situation and she told about the options of squatting with friends who live on the island during the week and go home on the weekend or looking for people like me who would be interested in sharing an apartment which meant cheaper rent and a place to call my own. It was a really hard choice both ways but I finally settled for a shared apartment with total strangers because I had a sense of ownership and freedom. It was strange initially but with time I adjusted and it became normal.
        </P>







        <P>As most companies plan and strategize on post Covid-19 office reopening, working remotely would be a very good option to consider. Human resource departments should not expect that it will be business as usual in the work style of their staff after the lockdown because workers have tasted the option of working remotely and have seen that they can be productive regardless of the location so they should begin to plan and strategize on how to incorporate the option of working remotely as a work style in their organizations.
        </P>

        <div class="firstimage">
          <p><img src="css/remot3.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="remote"></p>
        </div>


        <P>No doubt working remotely has its own challenges but with its juicy advantages, the challenges can be overcome if well managed. One of the major advantages of working remotely is the work-family life balance it gives. If most companies were to make this an option for their staff, my neigbour Mrs Amasa, a mother of two toddlers and a 4year son will be the first to embrace it. During in this lockdown, she has been so satisfied working from home and managing her domestic affairs very well. Before the pandemic she would have to leave home very early for work every morning without seeing their kids and return late at night when her kids have gone to bed leaving her home to be run by a hired help. She told me the other day that working remotely has made her more relaxed and focused on her work, and her output has improved because her mind is better coordinated now she can take care of her family and earn a living from home with much less stress.
        </P>



        <P>Some challenges of working remotely are family distractions, lack of focus, lack of motivation, convenient work space, effective time management, self-improvement amongst many others. These challenges can be overcome. I’d like to share some thoughts on how these challenges can be handled/resolved in my next post. Don’t touch that dial </P>
